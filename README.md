# Snake Game written in Cpp/C++

This is a simple classic snake game that I wrote in C++/Cpp
It uses SFML Graphics libraries to generate 2d images and graphical window


## Features:
- Food for the snake
- Increment of size upon snake eating food
- Increment of snake speed upon snake eating food
- Clean SFML Graphics

## How to Run:
- Use the Compiled binary given (Linux only)
- OR you can compile it yourself
  - To Compile it follow the steps:
  - Install SFML Libraries on your system (Windows / Linux)
  - Use GCC G++ Compiler to compile (Also Linking the SFML Libraries)
    - Bash or Cmd :$ g++ snake_game.cpp -o Snake_Game.out -lsfml-system -lsfml-window -lsfml-graphics
  - Bash or Cmd :$ ./Snake_Game.out
